Now that you are in the console, you has to select the project with `project <num>`.

Suppose that you want to check the project __0x00. C - Hello, World__<br>
The url is `https://intranet.hbtn.io/projects/212`<br>
So, the project's number is __212__
```console
CLI-@Checker ⚡$ project 212
0 - Preprocessor
1 - Compiler
